To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). You can also right-click and select 'inspect' to open a panel containing the Chrome DevTools on the right-hand side. Then select the 'console' tab from the top of the panel.

A console panel should open. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
