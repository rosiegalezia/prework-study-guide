        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the most basic building block of websites. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the <head> and <body> elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization, or SEO.</li>   
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language used to describe the presentation of a website that’s created with HTML and how each element on a webpage is rendered.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. To access Git, we use the command line.</li>
          <li>The git command must precede every Git statement.</li>
          <li>The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: we identify a Git command with the git keyword. Then use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch, e.g. main.</li>
          <li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work. Otherwise, you might be working on outdated code!</li>
          <li>The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch. The prefix, feature, indicates that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language that is used to provide logic and interactivity for websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>Strings need to be contained within quotation marks. For numbers (e.g. 54) and Boolean values (e.g. True), no quotation marks are necessary.</li>
          <li>Not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. </li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. A function must be called in order to execute it.</li>
